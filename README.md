# Bullet-Hell-Project
College project featuring a 2d bullet hell type of game

- Worked on this back in 2016 as a final college project with Stephen Yap and Ryan Reisen Tiongson Cua
- Crude and has memory leaks
- uses SFML for rendering
- biggest feature among others is the implementation of a basic uniform grid to handle the large amounts of entities on screen
- bullets only interact with each other and not the player nor the enemies
